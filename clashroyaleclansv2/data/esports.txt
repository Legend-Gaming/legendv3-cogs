__***LeGeND eSports***__

Our **LeGeND eSports League** is recruiting all active and aspiring competitive players!!

With the goal of encouraging competitive play through out family we have teams for every level of player.

__**Pro Team**__- The best of LeGeNDs members are on this team, if you aspire to play on a team with the likes of Demomzinator and Babyd this is the team for you!

__**Main Team**__- Tons of amazing players on this team, these players are working towards becoming Pro, this is a great team for you if you want to start getting into the competitive scene.

__**Academy**__- If you are looking to start getting more serious with the game, or if you are looking for some more practice to improve this is the team for you.

We have scrims across all of the time zones, so don't worry about that !!

Our strongest players will compete side by side with the very best in Leagues such as **CCTS**, **CPL**, and even **RPL!**

While we have a clan called LeGeND eSports!, the team operates separately from the clan, and sends members from all of our family clans to events.

But please remember that this is a more **professional** setting than the rest of the family and poor behavior will not be **tolerated!!**.
