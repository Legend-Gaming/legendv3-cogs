**Legend Family Rules**

To keep the Legend Family chat server, a positive, safe, and fun place to be for all, specific guidelines must be observed at all times by all members.

We value diversity and respect for others, and we strive to avoid offending users. For a pleasant experience, we don't allow using hateful, offensive, profane, antagonistic, or vulgar language in public areas.

3. Do not use offensive Profile Pictures.
4. Do not posting adult or inappropriate images/content.

Failure to adhere to the Legend Family code of conduct and our discord rules will result in swift action. You may be warned or asked to leave.


Help keep Legend a positive, enjoyable place where people have fun and grow. Be part of the fun and excitement Clash Royale brings, and let's keep our server an extension of the good times we all have in-game.

**Rules regarding transferring clans:**
• If you are transferring from one Legend Family clan to another, **please contact your current clan leader AND the destination clan leader**. Once approval is received from both parties, you may proceed with the transfer. We are all for members being wherever they want to be, but it helps us keep track of what is going on, and helps us make sure you get accepted.
• If you are leaving the clan for another reason, please talk with your leader first when possible. As a clan leader it helps to know if you're leaving for good, if you're leaving to do 2v2 with a few friends for a while, or if you're leaving for an eSport event.
